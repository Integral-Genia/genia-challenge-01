# AI Internship Challenge: Personal AI Assistant

## Overview
Build a simple command-line personal AI assistant that can help with everyday tasks. This challenge is designed to be completed in 1-2 hours and focuses on your ability to work with AI APIs and create something functional.

## The Challenge
Create a Python application that uses OpenRouter to power a personal assistant with at least **3 different capabilities** of your choice.

### Suggested Capabilities (pick 3 or more, or create your own):
- **Text Summarizer**: Paste in long text and get a concise summary
- **Email Drafter**: Describe what you need to say and get a professional email
- **Code Explainer**: Paste code and get an explanation of what it does
- **Language Translator**: Translate text between languages
- **Meeting Notes Formatter**: Convert messy notes into organized action items
- **Recipe Suggester**: Input ingredients you have and get recipe ideas
- **Study Helper**: Generate quiz questions from study material
- **Creative Writing Prompt Generator**: Get writing prompts based on genres/themes

Or come up with your own ideas! Be creative.

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Written in Python 3.12+ (use the latest stable version)
- Uses OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai) for AI functionality
- Runs locally via command line
- Has a simple menu system to choose between capabilities
- Includes a `requirements.txt` file with dependencies
- Includes a `README.md` with:
  - Brief description of what your assistant does
  - Setup instructions (how to install dependencies)
  - How to run the application (we'll provide the OpenRouter API key)
  - Example usage for each capability

### What We're Looking For
- **It works**: Can we clone your repo and run it successfully?
- **Clean code**: Is your code readable and organized?
- **Good documentation**: Can we figure out how to use it from your README?
- **Problem-solving**: Did you figure out how to work with the API?
- **Creativity**: Did you add any nice touches or unique features?

## Getting Started

1. **API Key**: We'll provide you with an OpenRouter API key to use for this challenge
2. **Choose your approach**: You can use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help you code - that's totally fine! We want to see how you build things.
3. **Pick your capabilities**: Choose 3+ features that interest you
4. **Build it**: Create your application
5. **Test it**: Make sure it works on your machine
6. **Document it**: Write clear setup instructions

## Example Project Structure
```
my-ai-assistant/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── assistant.py
└── (any other files you need)
```

**Note**: Your application should accept the OpenRouter API key as an environment variable or command-line argument so we can easily test it.

## Submission
1. Create a **public GitHub repository** with your code
2. Email us the repository link
3. Make sure your README is clear so we can run it!

## Tips
- Start simple and get something working first
- Accept the API key as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) or command-line argument
- Test each capability as you build it
- The OpenRouter documentation is helpful: https://openrouter.ai/docs
- Feel free to use AI assistants to help you code - that's what we do too!
- Make sure your code works with Python 3.12+

## Time Expectation
This should take 1-2 hours. Don't overthink it - we want to see you can build something functional, not something perfect.

## Questions?
If anything is unclear about the requirements, make your best judgment call and document your assumptions in your README.

Good luck! We're excited to see what you build. 🚀
